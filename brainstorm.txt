Chosen Idea:
Bingo Game
Add a new file called "sketch.jpg" to your GitHub project of a scretch of your chosen idea.

Why did you choose this idea? In other words, why was this idea evaluated higher than your other ideas. Explain with at least 3 sentences.
I wanted something challenging, but also something I was capable of doing. When a box on the board matches with the number it will cross out that box, using an X. When you win, it will tell you if you won, and if you loose, it will tell you that you lost. You loose if you don't get a "bingo" within 10 tries.
